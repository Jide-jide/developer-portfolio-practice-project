			<p>
				The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds about how to <i>sell</i> yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.

		<div class="about__two">
			<p>
				As a developer, you have everything available
				to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.
			</p>
			<p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
			<p>
				"How big would you dream, if you <strong>knew</strong> you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're <i>passionate</i> about.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm happy to chat over coffee some time
				about how I can help your company.
