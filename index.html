          <p>
            The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds about how to <i>sell</i> yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.
          </p>

          As a developer, you have everything available
          to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.
        </p>
        <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
        <p>
          "How big would you dream, if you <strong>knew</strong> you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're <i>passionate</i> about.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm happy to chat over coffee some time
          about how I can help your company.
